Exobase is a web framework that aims to solve the _ility_ that nobody ever talks about: _nimbility_. The ability to be nimbie, to change easily, is paramount. I started Exobase in 2018, not as a library or framework, but as a personal exploration to answer the question:

> how can I write web services and APIs without binding my code to the framework or having to rewrite my code if I need to change frameworks?

The core concepts of Exobase make up a design pattern called Abstract & Compose which was the eventual solution to my question.
